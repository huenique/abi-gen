# abi-gen

## Overview

This command-line tool is a thin wrapper for ethers-rs' [ethers_contract_abigen](https://docs.rs/ethers-contract-abigen/latest/ethers_contract_abigen/index.html). It offers a simple way to generate type-safe Rust bindings for Ethereum smart contracts directly from their ABI (Application Binary Interface).

## Usage

```bash
abi-gen -h
```
